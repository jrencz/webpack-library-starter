# Exceptions:
#
# Always describe exceptions!
#
# Always measure how much more the the compiled stylesheet weights
# when exception is added (you may use `du` for that) and check if
# exception is justified
#
# Always run `browserslist` cli tool (npm i -g browserslist-cli) to
# see if declaration you add results in correct resolution
